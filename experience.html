  <h2>Welding</h2>
    <p>I became interested in welding when I was a young boy helping out at a workshop.</p> 
    <p>I started buying my own welding rods and I would practice when everyone went on their lunch or at the end of their work day.</p>
    <p>Pretty soon I began to take it more seriously and I soon saved up enough money to take a basic welding course at the Metal Industrial Company (MIC).</p>
    <p>I worked with a company doing stainless steel welding on yachts for almost a year then went on to work with a Fire and Safeth company for three years.</p>
    <p>I mostly did installations of sprinklers for fires in buildings during my time there.</p>
    <p>A few years later I moved to Sint Maarten.</p>

  <h2>Night Auditor</h2>
  <p>So like I said earlier, I moved to Sint Maarten and I spent close to five years there.</p>
  <p>I was working as a freelance interviewer for the Department of Statistics.</p>
  <p>The job was great for me at the time. I got to work on my own time and because of that, it allowed me to be there for all of my wife's doctors appointment, as we were having our first child. So that was excellent.</p>
  <p>After the birth of my son I applied to the Alegria Hotel for the position of Night Auditor and I got the job.</p>
  <p>I was responsible for tallying up the day's earnings, correcting any mistakes that might of been done during the day shift and making sure that everything is in order for the Accounts Department and Human Resource manager the next day.</p>
  <p>Sadly hurricane Irma devastated the island and my family and I was soon flown back to Trinidad.</p>
  <p>Now I'm in the Beautiful island of St Croix USVI.</p>
