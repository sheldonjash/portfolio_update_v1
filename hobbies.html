  <h2>Basketball</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies and sport is Basketball.</p>
    <p>My all time favorite team is the L.A Lakers</p>
    <p>So far they look as though they can take the 2020 championship.</p>
    <p>With Lebron James, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Kyle Kuzma and the rest of the team, I believe they have a winning team.</p>
    <p>Hopefully one day I'll be able to see a game live.</p>

  <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>I've always loved gaming. It's a excellent way to pass time.</p>
    <p>I'm mostly into racing games, but I basically try anything I can get my hands on.</p>
    <p>But since starting the Front End Web Degree at <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">TeamTreeHouse.</a> I've noticed that the time I spend gaming can be put to better use in learning to code.</p>
    <p>So sadly <strong>BUT</strong> understandingly gaming is on pause.</p>

<section class="beach">
  <h2>Beach</h2>
    <p>What can I say, <strong>I LOVE GOING TO THE BEACH</strong>.</p>
    <p>It's a place where you can forget all about your hectic day and just drift away (not literally).</p>
    <p>To me it's relaxing and some may even say therapeutic, but please don't take my word for it.<br> Come see and experience it for yourself.</p>
    <p>I guarantee you, you won't want to leave &#x1F60A;</p>
    <p>My favorite beaches to go to in Trinidad is Maracas and Las Cuevas beach.</p>
    <p>For Sint Maarten I prefer Mullet Bay and Dawn beach.</p>
    <p>And last but not least for St Croix, I enjoy going to Rainbow beach, Cramer Park and Sunset beach just to name a few.</p>
