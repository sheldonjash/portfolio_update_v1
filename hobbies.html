  <div class="Basketball">
    <h1>Basketball</h1>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies and sport is Basketball.</p>
    <p>My all time favorite team is the L.A Lakers</p>
    <p>When I was younger, back in Trinidad I use to play with a team called Trailblazers.</p>
    <p>Thinking about it now... I miss those days.</p>

<div class="Gaming">
<h1>Gaming</h1>
<p>I've always loved gaming. It's a excellent way to pass time.</p>
<p>I'm mostly into racing games, but I basically try anything I can get my hands on.</p>
<p>But since starting the Front End Web Degree at<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">TeamTreeHouse.</a><br>I've noticed that the time I spend gaming can be put to better use in learning to code.</p>
<p>So sadly <strong>BUT</strong> understandingly gaming is on pause.</p> 
</div>

<div class="Beach">
<h1>Beach</h1>
<p>What can I say, <strong>I LOVE GOING TO THE BEACH</strong>.</p>
<p>It's a place where you can forget all about your hectic day and just drift away (not literally).</p>
<p>To me it's relaxing and some may even say therapeutic, but please don't take my word for it.<br> Come see and experience it for yourself.</p>
<p>I guarantee you won't want to leave &#x1F60A</p>
<p>My favorite beaches to go to in Trinidad is Maracas and Las Cuevas beach.</p>
<p>For Sint Maarten I prefer Mullet Bay and Dawn beach.</p>
<p>And last but not least for St Croix, I enjoy going to Rainbow beach, Cramer Park and Sunset beach just to name a few.</p>
<p>And I'm still discovering new ones.</p>
